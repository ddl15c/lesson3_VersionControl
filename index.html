            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a procedure used to record any changes to a file or groups of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. An example of a version control system used everyday by individuals is google docs. Google documents allow users to edit documents through the web and also allow users to share it with other individuals, allowing all users to edit the document. Version control comes into play because google docs keeps track of every change that the any user made and the users can revert back to any older version at anytime. Version control allows all web developers to be in more control of their work.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So if you are a beginner web developer you are probably thinking “ok, that’s cool. But how can version control help me develop applications.”  Well beginner web developer version control system offers a plethora of advantages for any web developer. for instance, a graphic designer is creating a logo for a client and he/she makes an error a version control system will the graphic designer to revert back to any previous state and attempt to finish his/her design. Additionally, it allows the graphic designer to compare designs over time. So he/she does not like where the design in heading he can return it to a previous state. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Beginner web developer we cannot talk about version control systems without mentioning Git. Now, before you start asking questions like “What is git?” or “What type of name is Git?” We will give give you a brief overview of how Git came to be.  It all began with Linux. The Linux kernel was maintained by a community of coders for most of its existence. Changes to the Linux software were passed through patches. In the year 2002 the Linux project began using Bitkeeper as DVCS. However, in 2005 the Linux community and and the creators of BitKeeper had a falling out with each other. So, Bitkeeper community revoke the tool from the community. Allowing the community to create their own tool for version control. A tool that was faster simpler, and stronger. Thus, Git was birth.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git: A different type of version control system. Everything you know about VCS should not be considered when thinking about Git. The big differences between Git and other VCS will be defined explained now. First, Git uses photographic memory whereas other VCS store information as a list of file-based changes. Every time a developer saves a state of project on Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at the time and stores a reference to that state. One more big difference of Git is that almost every operation is local. Meaning that Git on uses local files and resource to operate, there is no need to get data and information from a server. There are other major differences to Git that make it a superior version control system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git's Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three states of thinking committed, modified, and staged. Committed: data is securely stored in a local database. Modified: that a user has changed a file but have not committed it to your database. Staged: The user has mark a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. Now that we have established the states of a Git. Now we will go into the three major sections of a Git project. The Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The directory is probably the most important part of the project, this is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. The working tree is a checkout of one version of the project, these files are referenced from the database in the git directory and placed on a disk for to use or modify. Lastly, the staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Now that you know a little more about Git, lets start using it in our future projects.</p>
